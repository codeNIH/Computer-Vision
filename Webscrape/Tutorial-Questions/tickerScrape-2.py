# Goal: To retrieve price of most recent trade performed by a security of interest using web scraping

# Before looking at the code, try this on your own: 
# Create a script which asks the user to input a ticker symbol, and returns the current stock price of that security

# To complete this exercise, you will need to install/import both BeautifulSoup and requests (install using pip)

#   Bonus:
#       1) Print the date at which the stock price closed, and the full name of the security
#       2) Create a script that asks the user if they would like to search another stock price
